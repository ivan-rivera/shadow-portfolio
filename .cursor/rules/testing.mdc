- Use pytest for testing, NEVER use unittest or import from it
- Write tests for new functionality
- Write the shortest, most minimalist tests possible that cover core functionality
- Use coverage.py to track test coverage
- Use pytest-cov to report test coverage
- Use pytest-mock to mock dependencies
